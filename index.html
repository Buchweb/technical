        <article><p>Geology, or Earth Science or the Geosciences, is the study of the Earth, which includes its interior and exterior processes, rocks, minerals, fossils, and all the surface processes that have shaped the landscape around us and continue to shape our lives today.</p>
        <p>Geology Basics. ge·ol·o·gy, n. the science that deals with the physical history of the earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the physical changes which the earth has undergone and is currently undergoing.</p>
        <p>In geology there are three big ideas that are fundamental to the way we think about how Earth works.
<ul>
  <li>Geological Time</li>
  <li>Uniformitarianism</li>
  <li>Plate Tectonics</li>
</ul>

        <header><h2>What you should know</h2></header>
        <article><p>Geologists look at the different rocks, minerals and other materials that make up the earth's solid outer layer, called the crust. They also look at the other substances found buried in the earth's crust, like oil and natural gas. And they study major geological events, like volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and floods</p>
        <p>Three interesting facts about geology
          <ul>
            <li>There are 18 volcanoes in the US with the potential to erupt again, all of them in Alaska, Hawaii and the West Coast states.</li>
            <li>Rubies and sapphires are actually the same mineral - corundum. ...</li>
            <li>Rubies, sapphires and emeralds are all more rare than diamonds.</li>
            <li>Not all diamonds are transparent.</li>
          </ul>

        <header><h2>Who Is A Geologist?</h2></header>
        <article><p>A geologist is a scientist who studies the solid, liquid, and gaseous matter that constitutes Earth and other terrestrial planets, as well as the processes that shape them. Geologists usually study geology, although backgrounds in physics, chemistry, biology, and other sciences are also useful.</p></article>

        <header><h2>Branches In Geology</h2></header>
        <article><p>The Main Branches of Geology are of three major subdivisions</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Physical geology</li>
          <li>Historical geology</li>
          <li>Environmental geology.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Physical geology</h3>
        <p>Physical geology, scientific discipline that is concerned with all aspects of the Earth's structure, composition, physical properties, constituent rocks and minerals, and surficial features.</p>
        <h3>Historical geology</h3>
        <p>Historical geology or palaeogeology is a discipline that uses the principles and methods of geology to reconstruct the geological history of Earth. Historical geology examines the vastness of geologic time, measured in billions of years, and investigates changes in the Earth, gradual and sudden, over this deep time</p>
        <h3>Environmental geology</h3>
        <p>Environmental geology is the study of the interactions between humans and their geologic environment: rocks, water, air, soil, life. Humans are impacted by Earth processes, and by their activities have an impact on Earth.</p></article>

        <header><h2>Importance Of Geology As A Course</h2></header>
        <article><p>The education in Geology is organized by the Faculty of Sciences. This already shows something about the nature of the education: scientific courses, such as physics, chemistry and mathematics, are the cornerstones the education is based upon.</p>

<p>With specific techniques, based on these basic sciences, geology investigates the subterranean world. Geological knowledge not only is important because of the science in itself, but has a multitude of practical approaches:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the exploration of natural resources (ores, oil and gas, water, ...)</li>
  <li>the understanding and prediction of natural disasters (earthquakes and tsunamis, volcano eruptions, ...) and so on</li>
  <li>the understanding of out planets climate throughout time falls under the scope of geology.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this wide variety, several specializations have emerged, which are described in detail in the brochure 'Geology' (in Dutch), published by the Student Counselling Office</p></article>
